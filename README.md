This script encrypts any file found inside the working directory of the system and uploads the encryption key from memory to an express server.

You might be able to package the file into an exe so it would work without any dependencies as they are included but for now run `python3 < script >` to execute.
I have an express server setup on replit, goto the link here and fork the repl! Then start the server and update the urls in the client scripts :)
